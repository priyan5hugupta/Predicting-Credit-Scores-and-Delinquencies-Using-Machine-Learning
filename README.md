The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict credit scores and delinquencies, aiding financial institutions in assessing creditworthiness and making informed lending decisions. The dataset will include personal information (age, employment status, income), credit history (number of open accounts, length of credit history), and financial behavior (payment history, credit utilization, debt-to-income ratio). Preprocessing steps will handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize numerical features, and split the data into training and testing sets. Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Cross-validation will ensure models generalize well to unseen data, and the best model will be selected for deployment as a web-based application or API. This project aims to improve credit risk assessments, reduce default risks, and enable better financial decision-making, contributing to financial technology.
